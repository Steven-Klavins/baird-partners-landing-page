**Icons** 
The icons for the project were created using [Glyphter](https://glyphter.com/) a font icon generator, here is the character reference table for Glyphter.ttf

**Media Queries**
There are a number of media queries in the CSS, including two classes (mobile/mobile a) to enable the page to scale correctly.
